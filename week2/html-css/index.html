 	<h1>Welcome</h1>
  	<p>Many web servers are configured such that if you include a page called <em>index.html</em>, 
	it will be used as your default to your home page. For example, someone could type
	<em>http://nameofyoursite.com</em> into their browser and they'd get the same thing as if they typed
	<em>http://nameofyoursite.com/index.html</em>.</p>
	
	<p>Servi is set up to work this way when you use the 
		<a href="https://github.com/antiboredom/servi.js/wiki#simple-request---serve-any-file">serveFiles()</a> method.</p>
